## Core Chain-Based Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)
**Purpose**: Guides the model to reason step-by-step.
**Best for**: Logic problems, scripting, decision trees.
**Example Prompt**: 
"Letâ€™s reason through this step by step. First, what ports are usually scanned in a default Nmap TCP scan?"

---

### 2. Chain of Density
**Purpose**: Iteratively increases detail and complexity in the answer.
**Best for**: Documentation, refining tools, enhancing reports.
**Example Prompt**:
"Start with a basic explanation of Amass, then revise to include more context, real-world usage, and technical depth."

---

### 3. Chain of Memories
**Purpose**: Maintains session-level memory and references past content.
**Best for**: Workflow planning, recon strategies, multi-step logic.
**Example Prompt**:
"Earlier we discussed scanning techniques. Summarize what we covered, and build on it with post-processing methods."

### 4. Chain of Reflection
**Purpose**: Encourages the model to review and critique its own output.
**Best for**: Code improvement, report polishing.
**Example Prompt**:
"Now review that script. What are its weaknesses? How would you improve the structure or add logging?"

### 5. Chain of Verification
**Purpose**: Forces the model to evaluate its previous response using a framework.
**Best for**: Accuracy checking, code audits, security reviews.
